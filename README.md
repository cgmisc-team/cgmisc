## Introduction

**cgmisc** is a R package that enables enhanced data analysis and visualisation of results from GWAS. The package contains several utilities and modules that complement and enhance the functionality of existing softwares. It also provides several tools for advanced visualisation of genomic data and utilises the power of the R language to aid in preparation of publication-quality figures. Some of the package functions are specific for the domestic dog (Canis familiaris) data.

## Release philosophy
As of version 2.9.11, we are no longer using releases system. Instead, we maintain cgmisc in the CD/CI manner. From time to time, major versions will be frozen and available as source packages. Otherwise, track commit messages to know what has changed.

## Installation 
We recommend installing *cgmisc* by using:
`devtools::install_github('cgmisc-team/cgmisc')`

To install using the tarball, open a terminal and type: 
`R CMD INSTALL cgmisc_[version].tar.gz`
